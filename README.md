# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this exercise was to conduct an analysis on existing people data for Pewlett-Hackard in order to identify retirement eligible populations. This data is critical to future strategic planning in order to better prepare for the 'silver tsunami,' in which large groups of older employees are expected to retire.

## The Analysis
The analysis was conducted using PostgreSQL within the software tool pgAdmin. Data was sorted, aggregated, and exported using pgAdmin.

The criteria for "retirement eligible" was identified as any employee whose birth date falls within the years fo 1952 to 1955. 

Additionally, employee eligibility for a mentorship program. Only active employees were considered and their most recent job data was in scope.
